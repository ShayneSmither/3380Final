Final Project for CS3380

Team Members: Kartik Sharma, Xingyun Zhou, Shayne Smither, Youngbin Ha, Jeremiah Wooten

Project Description: An online photo album where a user can upload photos and add descriptions to each photo.
                     Tags can be added to photos to be able to sort the photos more easily. Upload times will 
                     be available for each photo. Descriptions for the photos are editable. First time users can 
                     create a new username and password.
